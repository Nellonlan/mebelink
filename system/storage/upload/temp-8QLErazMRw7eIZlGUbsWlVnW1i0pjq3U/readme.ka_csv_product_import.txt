----------------------------------------
CSV Product Import ver.4
----------------------------------------

Requirements
==============
- Opencart 2.0.1.0 - 2.1.0.x


How to install
==============

The extension is based on a new 'ocmod' technology introduced in opencart 2. Installation steps are
similar to installation of any other 'ocmod' extension. They are described below.

1) Log in to the store back-end and upload the whole archive at the 'Extension Installer' page and
   follow installation instructions.
   
   If you did not configure 'FTP settings' in your store you can avoid this step by installing
   'No FTP' patch available at this URL:
   
   http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=19862
      
2) If the zip archive is uploaded successfully, please refresh the page. After refreshing 
   a new 'Ka Extensions' menu item should appear in the left 'Extensions' menu under 
   'Extension Installer'.
   
3) Go to 'Ka Extensions' page and click on an 'Install' link next to the 'CSV Product Import' 
   extension.

4) A new 'CSV Product Import' menu item will be available in the 'Tools' menu after successful
   installation.
   
5) Make sure that the store front-end is available for customers. Some opencart versions 
   switch the store to 'Maintenance mode' after rebuilding the modification cache.
